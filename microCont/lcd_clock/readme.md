This program uses IC2 to receive the date and time and display it on a 128x32 OLED display.
Also included but commited out in maain.c is the feature to set the clock time, but after uploading this with the correct time, it is important to reupload this with those 2 lines again commented out, otherwise the time will be reset to that same value each time the microcontroller is powered up.
